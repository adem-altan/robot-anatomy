    - Arduino is connected and using correct COM port (COM9, etc.)
    - Your recordings/ folder exists
2. Open a terminal and run:
    `python start_record_on_serial.py`

3. Press the button on the Arduino setup
4. Camera will record for 57 seconds and save the .bag

Make sure camera recordings, ***.bag files, are copied into dedicated folders under data.
Results will be auto generated upon `batch_process` run.

To start listening for camera, run
```
python start_record_on_serial.py
